# Logbook

## [Unreleased]

- Arrr! Today marks the creation of this here logbook, to chart the course of our grand TypeScript voyage.
- The good ship was refitted from a humble vessel to a mighty monorepo, now boasting two holds:
  - The `course` cargo, brimming with lessons and exercises.
  - The `app01` galleon, our first full stack adventure, inspired by the "TS in the build process, Use vite for a front end app" scrolls.
- Rather than follow the old map to the letter, I charted a new course: a monorepo, and hoisted the TanStack Start flag in place of Vite.
- To set sail with the `app01` galleon in its basic form, run the command `npm run dev` from the main deck and heed the orders in the terminal.
- From this day forth, the crew abides by the code of Biome, our trusty checker, formatter, and linterâ€”may it keep our code free of barnacles!
- The winds have shifted! Abandoning the monorepo, I now steer a single app that will morph and evolve with each new course exercise. All hands on deck for a more focused adventure!

### How to Run and Build the App

- **To run the app in development:**
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  Then follow the instructions in the terminal to board the ship.

- **To build the app for production:**
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
  Once built, you can preview the app with:
  ```sh
  node .output/server/index.mjs
  ```

### 2024-06-11
- Added `router.tsx` to the `app01` galleon, with TanStack Router at the helm and type augmentation in the hold.
- Set up this logbook to chronicle our adventures and misadventures alike.
